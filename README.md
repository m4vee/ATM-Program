<h1 align="center"> <em><strong>ATM MACHINE PROGRAM</strong></em> </h1>

Welcome to the ATM Simulation Program, a simple yet robust simulation of an ATM system built with C++. This project replicates the core functionalities of a real ATM, allowing users to securely manage their accounts and perform essential banking operations.
  
Users can authenticate securely with a 4-digit PIN, check their balance, withdraw and deposit cash, and transfer funds between accounts. The program also allows users to change their PIN for enhanced security. With a focus on usability, this simulation provides a practical way to experience the convenience of modern banking.
